## Phase 1: Scanning files for split candidates


## File: lobby.tsx

-   Candidate reason: contains 5 conditional JSX branches
-   Created file branch: JediBranch/SplitLargeComponent/003300-20260521/lobby (worktree: /Users/ericwimsatt/git/jedi-targets/manhunt/.jedi-worktrees/manhunt-app/JediBranch--SplitLargeComponent--003300-20260521--lobby)

## Phase 2: Parallel OpenCode (1 tasks, 1 workers)


## OpenCode: lobby.tsx

-   Invoking opencode (/Users/ericwimsatt/.opencode/bin/opencode): You are refactoring the file `app/lobby.tsx` in a TypeScript/React Native project.

The automated scanner flagged this f...
-   opencode step completed.
-   No uncommitted changes after opencode (may have self-committed or no changes).
- Done with lobby.tsx.

## Phase 4: Cleanup

- Removed main worktree: /Users/ericwimsatt/git/jedi-targets/manhunt/.jedi-worktrees/manhunt-app/JediBranch--SplitLargeComponent--003300-20260521--base
